{"name":"Tangent Boards","tagline":"Tangent Boards is a small electric vehicle project for commuting and overall getting around. Essentially an electric longboard for now.","body":"Tangent Boards by Ryne Chaloux\r\nProject Overview\r\n\tMy project is Tangent Boards. The initial tangent board, which will be created during this class, is at its most simplest form, an electric longboard. I will be designing this board to be able to get around campus as well as conquer the morning commute to work. The board will be designed to be lightweight and portable to be able to go with the rider wherever they please.\r\n\r\nProject Approach\r\n\tThe initial Tangent Board will comprise of a wooden deck, longboard trucks/wheels, and electronics to make it motor powered. The electronics will consist of, a 2000W brushless motor, a 150A electronic speed controller, a 5AH LIPO battery, and a radio receiver to control the board wirelessly. I believe that the mounting mechanisms and welding, etc. will prove most challenging as well as learning the electrical side of things. I am the only team member on this project so Google and I will be doing all of the work.\r\n\r\nProject Objectives\r\nMajor Milestones:\r\nGet all needed parts/electronics. (4/17/2015)\r\nBuild Deck from scratch. (4/20/2015)\r\nMount all electronics to the deck/wheels/trucks. (4/27/2015)\r\nCreate an enclosure to keep the electronics safe. (5/4/2015)\r\nActually be able to ride this thing!. (5/1/2015)\r\n\r\nStretch Goals:\r\nLights for nighttime riding\r\nRegenerative braking\r\nCool Logo and Design on board\r\nNew Remote control\r\n\r\nConstraints, Risks, and Feasibility\r\nI believe this project to certainly be feasible as I am not the first person to do something like this, but for me it will be my first time working with these types of electronics and machinery so it will definitely be a challenge and a great learning experience for future endeavors.\r\n\r\nProject Development and Schedule\r\nDuring production, I will be using many different electronics that I have never used before. This is a challenge because you have to be able to know what exactly works with what else and make sure that everything then works together. Picking the right motor with the right speed control with the right battery proves more challenging than expected but it is fun to learn and make sure everything is as perfect as possible. I will also be machining many parts in aluminum and welding during this project. I have a 3D printer which will help with initial prototyping and making sure pieces fit correctly before machining.
